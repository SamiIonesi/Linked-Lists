# Linked-Lists
This repository describes the theory behind linked list data structures, as well as the different methods applied to them.

### What is a *linked list*?

A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a collection of elements called nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.<br>
Linked lists store elements in sequential order, but not necessarily in contiguous memory locations, because each node is stored in different memory locations.

### Types of linked lists

1. Singly linked lists
  - each node contains data and a pointer to the next node
  - traversal is unidirectional, only forward
2. Doubly linked lists
  - each node contains data an two pointers: one to the next node and one to the previous node
  - traversal is bidirectional, forward and backward
3. Circular linked lists
  - the last node is pointed to the head, forming a circle
  - can be singly or doubly linked
